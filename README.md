**Project - Customer Behavior Analytics**

Businesses increasingly rely on advanced analytics to predict customer behaviour and optimize operations. Accurately predicting whether a customer **will make a purchase** and estimating their **annual spending** allows companies to fine-tune marketing efforts, design personalized offers, and improve customer retention. However, this requires handling complex, noisy datasets, selecting the right features, and engineering new ones to capture nuanced customer behaviour.

**Objective :**

The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict the customer **Will_Purchase** or not and customers **Annual_Spending**.

1.	A **classification model** to predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase (Will_Purchase), using both direct and derived behavioural indicators.

2.	A **regression model** to predict the annual spending (Annual_Spending) of a customer, taking into account multiple nonlinear interactions and latent patterns.
